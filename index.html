    <h1>Martílio Rafael Banze</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Martilio Rafael Banze and I am a researcher in physics with an emphasis on the Use of High Performance Computing to Solve Physics Problems (Schrondiger Equation). My goal is to contribute to the understanding of Quantum Mechanics and improve technologies that can help solve challenges in industry and the world at large.</p>


    <p>I have a degree in Meteorology from Eduardo Mondlane University and in Physics and Mathematics from the Pedagogical University of Maputo. I am currently a High Performance Computing Administrator at the National Institute of Electronic Government, Public Institute (INAGE, IP)/MoRENet (Mozambique Research and Education Network).</p>
    <p>I have worked as a support scientist for the national academic and research community and have a background in data science. I have experience in Python, Matlab and also in the WRF Model.</p>
